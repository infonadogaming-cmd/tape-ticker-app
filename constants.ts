export const DEMO_TEXT = `The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. It's not like I'm using, Case heard someone say, as he shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the Chat. It's like my body's developed this massive drug deficiency. It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke. The Chatsubo was a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there for a week and never hear two words in Japanese.

Ratz was tending bar, his prosthetic arm jerking monotonously as he filled a tray of glasses with draft Kirin. He saw Case and smiled, his teeth a webwork of East European steel and brown decay. Case found a place at the bar, between the unlikely tan on one of Lonny Zone's whores and the crisp naval uniform of a tall African whose cheekbones were ridged with precise rows of tribal scars. "Wage was in here early, with two joeboys," Ratz said, shoving a draft across the bar with his good hand. "Maybe some business with you, Case?"

Case shrugged. The girl to his right giggled and nudged him.
The bartender's smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it. The antique arm whined as he reached for another mug. It was a Russian military prosthesis, a seven-function force-feedback manipulator, cased in grubby pink plastic. "You are too much the artiste, Herr Case." Ratz grunted; the sound served as laughter. He scratched his overhang of white-shirted belly with the pink claw. "You are the artiste of the slightly funny deal."

"Sure," Case said, and drank the beer. "Someone's gotta be funny around here. Sure hell isn't you."

The whore's giggle went up an octave. "Isn't you," she sang, "isn't you."

Case looked at her; she looked at him. She was small and dark and young. Her eyes were that same particular gray he'd seen in the eyes of the Panther Moderns, the ones who'd come in from the Sprawl. It was the gray of a television screen that wasn't getting a broadcast signal.

"Zone's been in?" Case asked Ratz.
"No. Not since the first week. He's probably in the Chiba Hilton, making his face look like someone else."
"I owe him money."
"He will forget," Ratz said. "He is very rich."
"Yeah." Case put his mug down. "I'm gonna go check the arcade."
"Be careful, artiste," Ratz said, and tapped the bar with his pink claw. "There are many who would like to be funny with you."

The arcade was called the Jarre de Thé. It was a long, narrow room, lined with video games. The air was thick with the smell of fast food and the ozone tang of the games. There were a few kids playing, their faces intent on the screens. Case walked past them, looking for Wage.

He found him in the back, watching a game called Tank War Europa. Wage was a large man, with a face that looked like it had been constructed from spare parts. He was wearing a cheap suit that was too tight across the shoulders.
"Wage," Case said.
Wage turned slowly. "Case. I've been looking for you."
"I heard."
"We need to talk."
"About what?"
"Business."
"I'm retired."
"Nobody retires," Wage said. "Not really."`;
